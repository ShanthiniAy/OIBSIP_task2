# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Python

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using the `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` libraries. EDA is a crucial step in any data science project to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and gather insights.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the code files to your local machine.

2. Replace `'Unemployment in India.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file in the Python code.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the code, and run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python eda.py
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run the code interactively using Jupyter Notebook.

4. The code will perform the following EDA tasks on your dataset:
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset for an initial overview.
   - Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - Check for missing values.
   - Create histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical data.
   - Create a box plot to identify outliers.
   - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix (if applicable).
   - Create a countplot for categorical variables (if applicable).

5. Customize the code and visualizations based on your specific dataset and research questions.

## Dataset

Please replace `'Unemployment in India.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file. Ensure that your dataset is in a compatible format, such as CSV.
